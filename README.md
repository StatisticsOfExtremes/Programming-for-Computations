# Programming-for-Computations
## Exercises from Programming for Computations

So, basically the main purpose of this repository is to upload some of the exercises of the book
*"Programming for Computations - Python"* -- at least the ones that I think are interesting, and some random Python code that are also interesting in the
DataCamp courses, like the random walk code. **That's it**.
